Webpack Simplest Example
========================

ðŸš€ A basic Webpack configuration to bundle a simple JavaScript application.

Description
-----------

This repository contains the simplest example of how to use Webpack to bundle a JavaScript application. The `webpack.config.js` file defines the basic configuration for Webpack to build a bundle from a single entry point (`src/index.js`) and output it to the `dist` folder as `bundle.js`. In addition, the configuration includes the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` to generate an HTML file with the title "Webpack Simplest Example".

Requirements
------------

-   Node.js (version 10.13 or later)

Installation
------------

1.  Clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/simplest-webpack-example.git`

1.  Install the dependencies:

`cd simplest-webpack-example
npm install`

Usage
-----

To build the bundle, run the following command:

`npm run build`

This will generate the `bundle.js` file in the `dist` folder and the `index.html` file with the title "Webpack Simplest Example". You can open the `index.html` file in your browser to see the application running.

Serve the dist files with:

`npm run serve`
